## Project Motivation
Diabetes is a global health concern affecting millions of people. This project explores the potential of machine learning in predicting diabetes, thereby enabling healthcare providers to take proactive measures. The project serves as a practical application of data science skills and aims to demonstrate the process of building a predictive model from scratch.

## Business Requirements
The key business requirements for this project are:

* High accuracy in diabetes prediction.

* Efficient handling and processing of missing data.

* Interpretability of the model's predictions for healthcare professionals.


## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains various health metrics such as:

* Glucose levels

* Blood Pressure

* Skin Thickness

* Insulin levels

* BMI (Body Mass Index)

* Other relevant features

Each of these features provides valuable information for predicting the likelihood of diabetes.

## Project Workflow
*  Data Cleaning: Handling missing values by replacing them with the mean or median, depending on the distribution.
*  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and relationships between features using visualizations and correlation matrices.
*  Model Building: Training a Random Forest Classifier to predict diabetes. The data is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
*  Model Evaluation: Assessing the model’s accuracy and analyzing the confusion matrix to understand its performance.

## Challenges and Learnings
The project presented several challenges:

* Handling Missing Data: Deciding on the best method to impute missing values.
* Feature Selection: Determining which features were most significant for predictions.
* Model Interpretability: Ensuring the model’s predictions were understandable by healthcare professionals.

Through these challenges, I gained valuable insights into data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation techniques.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting diabetes, highlighting its real-world implications. The model developed can assist healthcare providers in early detection and intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
